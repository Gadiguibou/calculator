# calculator

 A project to make a fully working on-screen calculator to deploy online.
 
 The deployment is available [here](https://gadiguibou.github.io/calculator/).
 
 The calculator currently supports chaining operations, has full keyboard support and floating point calculations. It could easily be expanded to support more operations. However this is more like a proof of concept.
